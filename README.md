This Spam Email identifier is based on the Multinomial Naive Bayes' method.



the src directory includes a naive.py file that contains the implementation of said method using a Laplace smoothing to avoid zero probabilities. The requirement for testing is that the train set emails should be in list format as \["message", "spam or ham", .......] and the test should also be in list format as \["test\_message", ........., "test\_message"]





FINALLY, to run the code, download the .zip file of this code and extract it. Open Terminal to the path and run jupyter notebook.

Traverse to the bottommost cell and press Shift + Enter to check if a input email is spam or ham.
